# Smithy mode

Provides font-lock for the [Smithy IDL](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/)

In the future this may be extended to more functionality, subject to progress on the [Smithy Language Server implementation](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-language-server)

## Installation
Smithy mode is available through MELPA.

Basic installation can be done as follows:

```
M-x package-refresh-contents<RET>

M-x package-install<RET>smithy-mode<RET>
```
