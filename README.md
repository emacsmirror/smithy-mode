# Smithy mode

Provides font-lock for the [Smithy IDL](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/)

In the future this may be extended to more functionality, subject to progress on the [Smithy Language Server implementation](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-language-server)

## Installation
Smithy mode is available through MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/smithy-mode

Basic installation can be done as follows:

```

M-x package-install<RET>smithy-mode<RET>
```
